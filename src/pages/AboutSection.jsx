          While my journey began in the structured realms of C# and .NET, where
          I delved into the exciting world of AR applications, my heart truly
          lies with JavaScript. Itâ€™s the versatility and dynamic ecosystem of
          JavaScript that have captivated me, allowing me to craft interactive
          and responsive web, mobile and desktop experiences with finesse and
          creativity.
